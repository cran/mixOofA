Description: A facility to generate various classes of fractional designs for order-of-addition experiments namely fractional order-of-additions orthogonal arrays, see Voelkel, Joseph G. (2019). "The design of order-of-addition experiments." Journal of Quality Technology 51:3, 230-241, <doi:10.1080/00224065.2019.1569958>. Provides facility to construct component orthogonal arrays, see Jian-Feng Yang, Fasheng Sun and Hongquan Xu (2020). "A Component Position Model, Analysis and Design for Order-of-Addition Experiments." Technometrics, <doi:10.1080/00401706.2020.1764394>. Supports generation of fractional designs for order-of-addition mixture experiments. Analysis of data from order-of-addition mixture experiments is also supported.
